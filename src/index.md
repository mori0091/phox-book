# 🦊 The Phox Programming Language

Phox is a small functional programming language.

It aims to be a simple yet expressive tool - your clever companion for exploring type theory and practical programming.

## ✨ Features

- **Hindley–Milner type inference**  
  No need to annotate types in most cases. (In fact, Phox has no type-annotation syntax)
- **Algebraic data types (ADT)**  
  Define expressive data structures with variants.
- **Pattern matching**  
  Concise and powerful destructuring.
- **Newtype shorthand**  
  Cleaner syntax for single-constructor wrapper types.
- **First-class functions**  
  Functions are values, operators are functions too.
- **Generic function temlates**  
  Non-first class / overloadable generic function templates.
- **Multi-parameter typeclasses (`trait`/`impl`)**  
  Define the relationship between multiple methods and multiple types.
- **Trait record**  
  Typeclasses (`trait`/`impl`) can be instansiated as a first-class record value, with a simple syntax.
- **Module system**  
  Rust like module / namespace definition.
- **Simple syntax**  
  Inspired by ML-family languages, with a focus on clarity.
